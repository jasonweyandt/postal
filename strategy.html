<h1>Things to Note</h1><br>
<p>When cards refer to any personality it includes the personality playing the card<br>

    Sam always moves before actions unless the card say OR then Sam will not move if the action is chosen<br>
    
    Sam only travels around the neighborhood in one direction, + movements are clockwise and - movements are counterclockwise<br>
    
    Sam can never move into the post office with a - move, he stops at the first space outside of the post office when moving counterclockwise even if he hasn't moved all spaces designated by the card<br>
    
    Basic Strategies<br>
    
    Save a therapy card to play as your first turn after you move Sam into the post office<br>
    
    Use a Scheming card to give an already eliminated personality a vendetta stamp</p>
