    <h1>New Hire Manual</h1>
<p>
    <h3>Setup</h3><br>

    (Pictograph of the game layout including board, draw pile, discard pile, starting location of Sam, players around the board)
    
    Place the gameboard in the middle of all personalities with Sam on the post office space
    
    Shuffle cards and deal out 2 cards to each personality, then place the remaining cards face down next to the board to be the draw pile
    
    Choose who goes first, they choose the direction of play and take the first turn<br>
    <h3>Your Turn</h3><br>
    <ol>
        <li>During your turn... (Pictograph of a hand playing a card)
    
    Choose a card from your hand and play it by discarding it in a discard pile which will form beside the draw pile. If the card has an OR on it choose which of the options you wish to do. Some options require that your personality be postal or sane </li><br>
    
    <li>Next... (Pictograph of Sam moving on the gameboard in a clockwise direction)
    
    Move Sam</li><br>
    
    <li>Next... (Pictograph of a hand drawing a card)
    
    Draw to your number of allowed cards</li><br>
    
    <li>Next... (Picture of the action stamp A)
    
    Resolve any actions associated with the card</li><br>
    
    <li>Finally... (Pictograph of the passing of play)
    
    Following the direction of play, the next personality begins their turn</li><br>
    <ul>
        <li>If the card you play moves the Sam, the postman, back to the Post Office then that turn immediately ends,
     do not draw a card or resolve any actions on the last card played. You then receive a postal counter,
      and begin by discarding down to the allowed number of cards for your hand,
       or drawing to reach the allowed number of cards for your hand, if applicable. You then begin a new round with Sam,
        the postman, starting from the post office.</li>
    </ul>
</ol>
    Continue taking turns until you reach the end of the year <br>
    
    <h3>End of a year</h3>
    
    When a personality needs to draw a card but none remain in the draw pile, then that is the end of the year,
     if at least 2 sane players remain then all cards except for the cards in personalities hands are shuffled
      into a new draw pile by the personality that was unable to draw and another year begins.Â <br>
    
    <h3>Winning</h3>
    
    If there is only one sane personality left at the end of a year that personality wins the game
    
    If all personalities are postal at the end of a year then the personality with the most postal counters wins the game. If there is a tie for the hightest amount of postal counters then all personalities continue playing. When one personality has the sole highest amount of postal counters that personality immediately wins the game
    
    Other ways to win
    
    If all but one personality is eliminated then the last surviving personality immediately wins the game<br>
    
    <h3>Personalities</h3>
    
    Sane personalities have 2 cards in their hand and win if they are the last sane person at the end of the year
    
    Postal personalities have 1 card in their hand per postal stamp they possess and win if they have the most postal stamps when all personalities have at least one postal stamp at the end of a year
    
    Marked personalities can be eliminated by a postal personality playing a Going Postal card
    
    Eliminated personalities have 0 cards in their hand and are out of the game, they can use vendetta stamps to take control of another personality's turn<br>
    
    <h3>Stamps</h3>
    
    Postal stamps are given to the personality that moves Sam the postman into the post office and are removed by playing cards
    
    Marker stamps are given by a postal personality playing a card and are removed by playing a card
    
    Vendetta stamps are given to the personality that removes a marker stamp and can be used by eliminated players to take control of another personality's turn</p>

    <h3>Eleminating a Personality</h3>

    A postal personality can play a Going Postal card and choose a personality that already has a marker stamp to eliminate them

    A personality with 5 postal stamps is eliminated immediately

    If a personality is eliminated they exchange their marker stamp for a vendetta stamp, if they have one

    When you are eliminated, you can then use your vendetta stamps. If Sam stops on a house, place your hand over the discard pile before another eliminated personality or before the personality playing lays their card down. By giving up the number of vendetta stamps equal to the number on the house, you take control of the hand of the personality who's turn it is and perform any actions, when finished you must give control of the hand back to its original personality

    <h3>Variants</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Blitz variant - personalities are dealt 15 cards, or less cards depending on the number of personalities playing. Once all personalities have played their hand anyone with a postal counter is eliminated and cards are shuffled and dealt again to the remaining personalities, if a personality doesn't have any cards in their hand their turn is skipped but other personalities can still use their cards towards that personality. These rounds continue until only one sane personality remains, if all the personalities have postal stamps after all cards have been played then the winner is whomever has the most postal stamps, if there is a tie for most then all personalities continue and cards are dealt again until one personality is the sole sane personality or when all personalities have a postal stamp, one personality has the most postal stamps. </li><br>

            <li>Trading variant - 3 cards per sane person. Trading cards can only be done with the personality whose turn it is and before playing a card. Trading is done by trust and can be broken. When the players agree to a trade both players lay their trading cards face down and then switch. Once the cards are switched the personality must keep the card given, even if it was not the card agreed upon. There can only be one trade per turn. Personalities are not permitted to show their hands to each other unless a card played requires them to do so. If a personality is caught showing their hand they must display their hand face up and each personality going in turn from the penalized personality may exchange one of their cards for a face up card from the penalized personalities hand.</li> <br>

            <li>Cutthroat Variant - personalities only win by being the last surviving personality. Additionally only personalities with at least one postal stamp may have a marker stamp. If a personality removes all their postal stamps they may also remove a marker stamp if they have one.</li><br>

            <li>Postal Variant - players race to be the first personality to get a 6th postal counter, each player's hand allowance is capped at 4 cards </li><br>
